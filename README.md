# 10000-League-Games
This was the final (solo) project for IST 652. The data, taken from Kaggle, contained a snapshot of team stats at the ten-minute mark of 10,000 Diamond Ranked League of Legends games.

The goal of this project was to create models to predict wins and losses and extract the most informative features to develop a game plan to improve at the game. It was a great lesson in data cleaning before training models with the biggest issue with this data is the high correlations between several of the independent variables.
